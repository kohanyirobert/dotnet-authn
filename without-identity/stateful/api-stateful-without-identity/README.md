# API + ~~Cookie~~ ~~Session~~ Stateful(?) Auth w/o Identity

## Points of Interest

- I didn't create this example yet, but I would create the same project as with [`api-basic-without-identity`](../../../without-identity/basic/api-basic-without-identity/README.md) and then configure the
  cookie-based authentication from [`mvc-stateful-without-identity`](../../../without-identity/stateful/mvc-stateful-without-identity/README.md)
- This is not terribly useful or complicated, maybe some other time (as here we have no "login mechanism" by default as
  with basic authentication, this would have to be tested with `curl` or similar)
